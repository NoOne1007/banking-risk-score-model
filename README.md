# banking-risk-score-model
"The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning–powered risk scoring system that predicts the probability of loan default based on customer demographics, financial behavior, and credit history. The model will help financial institutions improve credit approval decisions, optimize portfolio risk, and reduce non-performing assets."
